# Decision Tree from scratch
The accuracy of predicting the Iris dataset using scikit-learn is an important benchmark. 
A Decision Tree in Machine Learning is one of the most reliable techniques for categorizing data based on multiple features. 
The dataset includes petal width and length as well as sepal width and length. 
The goal is to predict the flower type based on these features.
In conclusion, the Decision Tree method achieves an accuracy of 93% when using the Gini index (information gain method).

## Features
- Load data from scikit-learn using the pandas library
- Object-oriented programming to create nodes and integrate recursion
- Two information gain methods: Gini & Entropy
- Feature prediction
- Accuracy measurement

## Technologies
- Python 3
- scikit-learn library
- pandas library
- numpy library

## How to Run
1) Open the notebook
You can run the code either in Google Colab (recommended for easy setup) or in VS Code with the Jupyter Notebook extension installed.

2) Install dependencies
Make sure you have the required libraries installed. If running locally, install them using:
pip install numpy pandas scikit-learn

3) Load the notebook
Open the file DecisionTreeFromScratch.ipynb in your chosen environment.

4) Run all cells
In Google Colab: click Runtime > Run all.
In VS Code: use the Run All option in the Jupyter Notebook toolbar.

5) View results
The notebook will display the accuracy of the Decision Tree model, predictions
on the Iris dataset, and comparisons between Gini and Entropy methods.
