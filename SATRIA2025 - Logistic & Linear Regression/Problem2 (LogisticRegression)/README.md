# Linear Logistic Implementation (Smart AI & Tech Competition for a Rising Indonesia 2025 - Gold award)
Linear Logistic Implementation: predict the age of abalones based on various characteristics. 
Abalones, a type of marine mollusk, have been studied extensively for their biological traits and growth patterns, 
making them an ideal subject for such predictive modeling tasks.

## Features
- Load data from scikit-learn using the pandas library
- data plotting using matplotlib
- mean_squared_error, r2_score
- Accuracy measurement (graph analizing)

## Technologies
- Python 3
- scikit-learn library
- pandas library
- numpy library
- matplotlib library

## How to Run
1) Open the notebook
You can run the code either in Google Colab (recommended for easy setup) or in VS Code with the Jupyter Notebook extension installed.

2) Install dependencies
Make sure you have the required libraries installed. If running locally, install them using:
pip install numpy pandas scikit-learn matplotlib

3) Load the notebook & data
Open the file LogisticRegression_Problem2.ipynb with the file data_problem_2.csv in your chosen environment.

4) Run all cells
In Google Colab: click Runtime > Run all.
In VS Code: use the Run All option in the Jupyter Notebook toolbar.

5) View results
The notebook will display the data to compare effective models
