# Linear Logistic Implementation (Smart AI & Tech Competition for a Rising Indonesia 2025 - Gold award)
a linear regression model to estimate the likelihood of a student passing the admission selection for XYZ University. The goal is to use the information provided in the dataset to make accurate predictions about a student's chances based on their academic background and demographic factors.

## Features
- Load data from scikit-learn using the pandas library
- data plotting using matplotlib
- mean_squared_error, r2_score
- Accuracy measurement (graph analizing)

## Technologies
- Python 3
- scikit-learn library
- pandas library
- numpy library
- matplotlib library

## How to Run
1) Open the notebook
You can run the code either in Google Colab (recommended for easy setup) or in VS Code with the Jupyter Notebook extension installed.

2) Install dependencies
Make sure you have the required libraries installed. If running locally, install them using:
pip install numpy pandas scikit-learn matplotlib

3) Load the notebook & data
Open the file LinearRegression_Problem1.ipynb with the file data_problem_1.csv in your chosen environment.

4) Run all cells
In Google Colab: click Runtime > Run all.
In VS Code: use the Run All option in the Jupyter Notebook toolbar.

5) View results
The notebook will display the data to compare effective models
