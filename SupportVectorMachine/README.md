# Support Vector Machine Implementation
The accuracy of predicting the Iris dataset using scikit-learn is an important benchmark. A Support Vector Machine in Machine Learning is one of the most reliable techniques for categorizing data based on multiple features. The dataset includes petal width and length as well as sepal width and length. The goal is to predict the flower type based on these features. In conclusion, the Support Vector Machine method achieves an accuracy of 90%.

## Features
- Load data from scikit-learn using the pandas library
- data plotting using matplotlib
- model prediction after learning the data

## Technologies
- Python 3
- scikit-learn library
- pandas library
- numpy library
- matplotlib library

## How to Run
1) Open the notebook
You can run the code either in Google Colab (recommended for easy setup) or in VS Code with the Jupyter Notebook extension installed.

2) Install dependencies
Make sure you have the required libraries installed. If running locally, install them using:
pip install numpy pandas scikit-learn matplotlib

3) Load the notebook & data
Open the file SupportVectorMachine_Implementation.ipynb.

4) Run all cells
In Google Colab: click Runtime > Run all.
In VS Code: use the Run All option in the Jupyter Notebook toolbar.

5) View results
The notebook will display the data and the accuracy in the end
